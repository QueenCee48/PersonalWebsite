          A commission piece for a friend of a friend. I did two versions, a light angel and a dark angel, but I think this one was my favorite. He had a sketch and very detailed 
          notes on what he wanted which was very helpful. Most people that want a commission are indecisive or have no clue what they want at all. I drew the character based on
          the person requesting the artwork. It was for his album he was releasing. The font was from a website he picked out and the background was generated using AI. I made some 
          adjustments and added some overlay effects to make everything cohesive and work together. He was very pleased with the work and so was I.

          I wanted to try the grayscale challenge I keep seeing on Instagram and TikTok, but I wanted to try drawing someone free-hand. Why not be my own muse? Plus I haven't 
          drawn a self portrait in a couple years. Basically, I chose a color pallette which consisted of mostly blues, greens and purples. Then I put my iPad in grayscale which 
          made literally everything on the screen appear in grayscale. Then I shuffled the pallette around so I didn't know where each color was. Then you have to rely on matching 
          the values in grayscale to the reference photo (which also appeared in grayscale). When I finished, I was actually pleased with how it came out...but it was mainly 
          green and blue which I didn't feel fit the vibe it was giving. I ended up adjusting the hue, saturation, brightness, and curves to make it more blue. Seems like I'll have 
          to keep making a self portrait every 2 years.

          Season 1, Episode 9 of my Art Style Challenge series. This one is J.Cole in the style of Garfield. This version of J.Cole is based on the music video for the song
          <i>[The Jackie] - Bas & J.Cole feat. Lil Tjay</i>. This drawing is my favorite of all the Season 1 drawings so far. The last one on the list is Ariana Grande in the style 
          of Total Drama Island...we shall see how that goes.

          Another self portrait 2 years later. I wanted to try a new coloring technique I saw someone do on Instagram or YouTube...I can't remember. But anywaysss, it is a 
          much longer method than I am used to, but the results are pretty smooth. Basically, I traced my picture for the outline and then I color-picked a spot on my photo and
          colored a small circle in that same spot on the coloring layer. After the whole picture is filled with a ton of colored circles, I blended them together with a smudge 
          brush. That is how I colored the whole thing. Waaay too much work. Ask me if it was worth it...

          Season 1, Episode 5 of my Art Style Challenge series. I have two lists of 10, one of famous people and the other of cartoons. I spin a wheel twice to randomly pick
          an artist and a cartoon. Whoever I get, I draw them in the art style of the cartoon. This one is Jhene Aiko in the style of Totally Spies. This version of 
          Jhene is from photos she posted March 20, 2022 on Instagram. She was at the Smokin' Grooves Music Festival.

          This is an original character I made in April of 2020. I used an app called Gemsona Maker to create a character in the Steven Universe style. Then I found a reference 
          picture on Pinterest for the pose I wanted. Once I had those set, I drew the character free-hand in my style at the time (which really was non-existent). I was trying 
          exercises to develop an art style. This piece to the right, is the updated version of the character after developing my skills for some years. This time around,
          I found a base pose sketch for the body and then re-drew the character based on the pose. I wanted to focus on the stylization of the character than spend too
          much time trying to make up and draw a pose. I definitely like this version better. She does not have a name though.

          This is Ava. She is another one of my original characters. I used an app called Monster Girl Maker 2 to create a character, then I found a base sketch on pinterest for 
          the pose and made a few adjustments. Then I re-created the character I made in the app into Ava. She happens to be a twin, her sister is Mia...but you won't be seeing her 
          cause she is my least favorite drawing of the two.

          I am terrible with naming characters but this is an original character I created based on a TikTok challenge. He is male because I have glasses. The hair is supposed to be 
          short since I have siblings...I opted for an up-do cause I really wanted to draw locs for some reason. The color of the hair is my favorite color since I don't have a pet. 
          The eyes are also my favorite color. The clothes are meant to match my phone case...my phone case is clear with sparkles...so I went with a sheer top. I'm actually 
          surprised with how well he turned out.

          This one here came out better than I thought it would! I have been drawing characters from one show in the style of another show. In this case, I drew Rick from 
          Rick and Morty in the art style of the Simpsons. I was unsure of this one at the start, but I have to say...I think the Simpsons team should hire me...just saying.

          Another commission piece but this time for my friend/coworker. I thought I was going to have a hard time drawing him and making it look accurate. I have been struggling to draw full
          faces...but this ACTUALLY looks like him and I am so proud. I'm really happy with how it all came together and he liked it also. Oh p.s. ...that is his actual car
          behind him, I did pretty good on that part too.

          A commission piece for a friend of a friend. As you can see, I cannot draw faces to save my life. How do we resolve that?...just skip the face altogether, easy fix!
          He had a basic idea of what he wanted but the rest was all up to me. I told him the girls didn't have faces so that they didn't draw attention away from him.
          He still liked the piece so that's all that matters right?

          My first self portrait.....I lied, it is definitely not my first one overall buuut, it is the first one that I actually like. The first one is the worst drawing
          ever in the history of drawings. I have been drawing a lot of these portraits for other people as practice. Figured it was about time to put my new found skills to
          work and make one for myself. I think she's pretty cute...in a non-conceited way.
