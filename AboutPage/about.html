        <h2 id="started" >How I Started</h2>
        <p id="started-text">
          Let's start from the beginning...<br>
          When I was growing up, I was very crafty and interested in technology. I would always play any video game I could get my hands on. I loved playing computer games 
          since that's all I had at home (I gravitated towards dress-up or parking games). I was also the person everyone went to for drawings. I started off as a traditional 
          artist using paper and pencil. I vividly remember pausing the SpongeBob movie and placing a paper over the screen so I could trace the picture. At the Boys and Girls Club,
          I got into graffiti for a while. Finally, one birthday, my father got me a Samsung tablet. From that point on, I became a digital artist. I started off trying to 
          make portraits of people since that was popular at the time. Eventually, I was able to branch out and start doing commissions. My love for technology has also grown. I 
          still play video games and have started learning about programming and website development. I am currently working on a BS in Information Technology with a 
          concentration in Digital Media. I believe this is the perfect degree to combine my love for arts and technology.

        <ul id="fact-list">
          <li>I plan to have a game room, in my future home, filled with all the game systems I grew up playing.</li>
          <li>If there was a fire in the house and I had to save one device, I would save my iPad over saving my iPhone.</li>
          <li>I have some beginner experience in 3D sculpting, animating, pixel art, and video editing.</li>
          <li>I used to draw clothing and items for a game called Everskies. When the players purchased the items with in-game currency, I was able to exchange that currency for USD.</li>
          <li>I drew and animated that pixel portrait.</li>
